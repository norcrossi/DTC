> AC Machine Simulation in C (Tutorial Version)

I have used C to simulate motor control and adptive observers for 4 years now.
This is a tutorial for those who hate using Simulink to simulate motor control.

The numerical integration method is currently RK4, which is quite enough. 
DoPri54 will be included in future revision.

Introduction on current branches:
- master: the skeleton with induction motor simulation and VVVF control.
- foc: field oriented control (direct/indirect) with basic sensorless control.
